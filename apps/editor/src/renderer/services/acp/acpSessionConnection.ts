 *  AcpSessionConnection — the connection lifecycle state machine for one
 *  AcpSession. Replaces the scattered `_conn` / `_connectionSettled` /
 *  `_resolveConnected` / `_whenConnected` / `_queuedPrompts` fields that
 *  previously encoded this implicitly, where correctness depended on every flag
 *  being kept in sync by hand.
 *
 *  Phases (one-way, terminal-absorbing):
 *
 *      connecting ──open()──► connected
 *          │
 *          ├──fail()────────► failed
 *          │
 *          └──close()───────► closed   (also reachable from connected)
 *
 *  Invariants the previous flag soup did NOT guarantee, now enforced here:
 *  - `connecting → failed` REJECTS every queued prompt with a clear error
 *    (the old `failConnection` silently dropped them — the caller's message was
 *    shown on screen but never sent and never surfaced as an error).
 *  - The "connecting settled" gate (`whenSettled`) resolves on EVERY exit from
 *    `connecting` (connected / failed / closed), so awaiters never hang.
 *  - A prompt enqueued while connecting is dispatched exactly once on connect,
 *    or rejected on fail/close — never lost.
